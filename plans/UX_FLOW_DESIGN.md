## Core Feature Flows

### 1. Device Discovery & Interview Flow

#### Entry Points
- Initial conversation on startup
- When the user asks to spend some time on setup and configuration of rooms and devices

#### Flow Steps

**Conversational Discovery Process:**
1. System guides through discovery steps:
   - Step 0: "Let me set up your House Model to remember everything"
   - Step 1: "What's your house address?" (or use location)
   - Step 2: "I'll find your local weather forecast"
   - Step 3: "Do you have Apple HomeKit?" (auto-import if yes)
   - Step 4: "Let's explore your house room by room"
   - Step 5: "Tell me about devices in this room"
   - Step 6: "Any outdoor devices like weather stations?"
   - Step 7: "What about HVAC or whole-house systems?"
2. System categorizes discovered devices:
   - Known devices (already integrated)
   - Well-known devices (need auth setup)
   - Novel devices (creates GitHub issue)
3. User reviews device list and adds details and authentication
9. System creates devices:
   - Success → "Device is now setup, this is it's current status"
   - Novel device → "I'll research this and update the system later"

#### Success State
