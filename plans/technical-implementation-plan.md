# Technical Implementation Plan: House Consciousness System

## Project Overview

The House Consciousness System is an IoT observability and introspection platform that enables natural language conversations with connected homes. The system provides emotional intelligence, contextual awareness, and proactive assistance based on the STPA (System Theoretic Process Analysis) control architecture.

**Core Philosophy**: Implementing consciousness as observability - giving houses the ability to model their state, learn from experience, and communicate their "feelings" and needs to occupants.

## System Architecture

2. **Control System Layer**: Consciousness engine with emotional modeling
3. **Human Operator Layer**: Occupant interfaces (web app, mobile, voice)
