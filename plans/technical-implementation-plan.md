# Technical Implementation Plan: House Consciousness System

## Project Overview

The House Consciousness System is an IoT observability and introspection platform that enables natural language conversations with connected homes. The system provides emotional intelligence, contextual awareness, and proactive assistance based on the STPA (System Theoretic Process Analysis) control architecture.
