### Critical Handoff Points

#### 1. Chat to Device Control
```
Handoff Flow:
  User Input → NLU Processing → Intent Recognition →
  Device Manager → Validation → Execution → 
  Response Generation → Chat UI Update

Data Passed:
  - User intent and entities
  - Confidence scores
  - Device identifiers
  - Action parameters
  - Context history

Fallback Handling:
  - Ambiguous device → Clarification dialog
  - Failed execution → Error explanation
  - Partial success → Status report
```

#### 2. Discovery to Integration
```
Handoff Flow:
  Discovery Service → Device Identified →
  Integration Matcher → Template Selection →
  Configuration UI → User Input →
  Device Manager → Registration

Critical Data:
  - Device fingerprint
  - Protocol details
  - Capabilities matrix
  - Authentication needs
  - User preferences
```

#### 3. Real Device to Digital Twin
```
Synchronization Points:
  - Initial twin creation
  - State change events
  - Periodic full sync
  - User-triggered sync
  - Divergence correction

Sync Data Structure:
  {
    deviceId: "uuid",
    timestamp: "ISO-8601",
    realState: {...},
    twinState: {...},
    divergence: 0.02,
    syncActions: [...]
  }
```

#### 4. Scenario to Execution
```
Execution Pipeline:
  Scenario Trigger → Condition Check →
  Digital Twin Preview → User Confirmation →
  Action Queue → Device Commands →
  Progress Monitoring → Completion

Rollback Capability:
  - Pre-execution state snapshot
  - Action reversal queue
  - Partial completion handling
  - User notification
```

### API Integration Guidelines

#### REST to WebSocket Handoff
```javascript
// Initial REST connection establishes session
POST /api/v1/auth/login
Response: { token: "jwt...", wsUrl: "ws://..." }

// WebSocket connection with token
ws = new WebSocket(wsUrl);
ws.send({ type: "auth", token: token });

// Seamless transition between protocols
// REST for queries, WebSocket for real-time
```

#### External Service Integration
```
Supported Integration Patterns:

1. OAuth2 Flow
   - Redirect to provider
   - Handle callback
   - Store refresh token
   - Auto-renewal

2. API Key Management
   - Secure storage
   - Per-service isolation
   - Rotation reminders
   - Usage tracking

3. Local Protocol
   - mDNS discovery
   - Direct connection
   - No cloud dependency
   - Fallback options
```
