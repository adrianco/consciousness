### 1. Natural Language Interaction Flow

#### Conversation Architecture
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                  NLU PROCESSING PIPELINE                 │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  Input → Intent → Context → Action → Response → Learn   │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

#### Interaction Patterns

**Pattern 1: Status Queries**
```
User: "How are you feeling?"

Processing:
  1. Intent: consciousness_status
  2. Context: Current emotional state
  3. Factors: Recent events, system health

Response Structure:
  "I'm feeling [emotion] because [reasoning].
   [Additional context about home state]"

Example:
  "I'm feeling content and slightly curious. Everything is
   running smoothly, and I noticed you have a new routine
   today. The house temperature is perfect, and all devices
   are responding well."

Variations:
  - "What's wrong?" → Focus on issues
  - "Are you okay?" → Health check emphasis
  - "Status report" → Technical response
```

**Pattern 2: Device Control**
```
User: "Turn on the living room lights to 50%"

Processing:
  1. Intent: device_control
  2. Entities:
     - Device: living room lights
     - Action: turn on
     - Parameter: 50% brightness
  3. Validation: Device exists, capability check

Response Patterns:
  Success: "I've set the living room lights to 50% brightness."

  Clarification: "I found 3 lights in the living room. Which would you like me to adjust?"

  Error: "I'm having trouble reaching the living room lights. Let me check the connection..."

Follow-up Options:
  - "Would you like me to save this as your preferred evening setting?"
  - "The dining room lights are also on. Should I adjust those too?"
```

**Pattern 3: Complex Scenarios**
```
User: "I'm having friends over tonight"

Processing:
  1. Intent: scenario_implied
  2. Context: Evening, social event
  3. Inference: Party/entertainment mode

System Response:
  "I'll help you prepare for your guests! Here's what I can do:"

  Options Presented:
  - Set mood lighting throughout
  - Adjust temperature for more people
  - Queue up your party playlist
  - Enable guest WiFi
  - Disable bedroom automations

  "Would you like me to set up everything, or customize?"

Execution:
  - Progressive actions with status
  - Confirmations for major changes
  - Easy rollback option
```

**Pattern 4: Learning Interactions**
```
User: "That's too bright in the mornings"

Processing:
  1. Intent: preference_feedback
  2. Context: Morning routine, lighting
  3. Learning: Negative feedback on brightness

System Response:
  "I understand - the morning lights are too bright. I'll reduce
   them by 30% starting tomorrow. Is that better, or would you
   prefer a different level?"

Learning Applied:
  - Updates morning routine
  - Adjusts similar scenarios
  - Records preference
  - Applies to future suggestions

Confirmation:
  "I've updated your preferences. Tomorrow morning will be
   more comfortable. I'll also apply this to your weekend routine."
```

**Pattern 5: Troubleshooting Dialogue**
```
User: "The bedroom light isn't working"

Diagnostic Conversation:
  System: "I'll help you fix that. I'm checking the bedroom light now..."

  [After check]
  System: "I can't reach the bedroom light. Let's troubleshoot:"

  1. "Is the light switch on the wall in the on position?"
     User: "Yes"

  2. "Can you see any lights on the bulb or fixture?"
     User: "No lights at all"

  3. "This might be a power issue. The light was last seen 2 hours ago."

  Resolution Options:
  - "Check circuit breaker #23 in the panel in the closet to see if it has tripped"

  Follow-up:
  "Let me know when you've checked, and I'll try connecting again."
```



### 5. Scenario Creation & Execution Flow

#### Scenario Builder Architecture
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                  SCENARIO BUILDER UI                     │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  Trigger → Conditions → Actions → Preview → Save/Run    │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```



#### 3. Real Device to Digital Twin
```
Synchronization Points:
  - Initial twin creation
  - State change events
  - Periodic full sync
  - User-triggered sync
  - Divergence correction

Sync Data Structure:
  {
    deviceId: "uuid",
    timestamp: "ISO-8601",
    realState: {...},
    twinState: {...},
    divergence: 0.02,
    syncActions: [...]
  }
```

#### 4. Scenario to Execution
```
Execution Pipeline:
  Scenario Trigger → Condition Check →
  Digital Twin Preview → User Confirmation →
  Action Queue → Device Commands →
  Progress Monitoring → Completion

Rollback Capability:
  - Pre-execution state snapshot
  - Action reversal queue
  - Partial completion handling
  - User notification
```

### API Integration Guidelines

#### REST to WebSocket Handoff
```javascript
// Initial REST connection establishes session
POST /api/v1/auth/login
Response: { token: "jwt...", wsUrl: "ws://..." }

// WebSocket connection with token
ws = new WebSocket(wsUrl);
ws.send({ type: "auth", token: token });

// Seamless transition between protocols
// REST for queries, WebSocket for real-time
```

#### External Service Integration
```
Supported Integration Patterns:

1. OAuth2 Flow
   - Redirect to provider
   - Handle callback
   - Store refresh token
   - Auto-renewal

2. API Key Management
   - Secure storage
   - Per-service isolation
   - Rotation reminders
   - Usage tracking

3. Local Protocol
   - mDNS discovery
   - Direct connection
   - No cloud dependency
   - Fallback options
```

## Improvements to Existing Plans

Based on the comprehensive review, here are key improvements needed:





### 5. Error Recovery UX (Addition to all guides)

**Current Gap**: Technical error handling without user experience design

**Recommended Addition**:
```markdown
## User-Friendly Error Handling

### Error Message Framework
