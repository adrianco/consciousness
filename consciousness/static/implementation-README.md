- Multiple report formats (Markdown, JSON, CSV)
- Real-time testing with WebSocket monitoring support

**Key Classes:**
- `EnhancedConsciousnessAPIClient`: Main enhanced client with testing features
- `APITestSuite`: Organized test execution by functional categories

### 3. JavaScript Functions Integration

**Core Functions Added:**
- `testSingleEndpoint()`: Test individual API endpoints with comprehensive error handling

## GitHub Integration Features

### Configuration
- **GitHub Token**: Secure token storage in localStorage
- **Repository**: Target repository for uploads (username/repository format)
- **Branch**: Target branch (default: main)

### Upload Functionality
- **Test Results**: Upload comprehensive test data as JSON
- **Test Reports**: Upload formatted Markdown reports
- **Commit Management**: Custom commit messages and file paths
- **Upload History**: Track uploads with direct commit links

### Report Generation
- **Markdown Reports**: Formatted reports with summaries, environment details, and performance metrics
- **JSON Exports**: Raw test data with complete metadata
- **Download Capability**: Browser-based file downloads with timestamped filenames

## User Workflow

### API Testing Workflow
1. Navigate to the **API Testing** tab
2. View current test statistics (total endpoints, tested, successful, failed)
3. Execute quick tests for instant validation of common endpoints
4. Run comprehensive test suites for full API coverage
5. Use custom test interface for specific endpoint testing
6. Monitor real-time results and performance metrics
7. Export results for analysis or sharing

### GitHub Integration Workflow
1. Configure GitHub settings in the **GitHub** tab (one-time setup)
2. Execute API tests to generate comprehensive results
3. Customize commit message and target file path
4. Upload test results directly to GitHub repository
5. View upload history with direct links to commits
6. Download local copies of results and reports

## Technical Implementation Details

### Rate Limiting
- 500ms delay between sequential API tests to prevent server overload
- Configurable timeout settings for different endpoint types
- Intelligent retry mechanisms for failed requests

### Error Handling
- Comprehensive error capture for all API interactions
- User-friendly error messages with specific details
- Graceful degradation when services are unavailable
- Network connectivity and authentication error handling

### Performance Monitoring
- Response time tracking for all API calls
- Success rate calculations and trending
- Performance metrics included in all reports
- Real-time statistics updates during test execution

### Data Management
- Test results stored in structured JSON format
- Persistent configuration using localStorage
- Automatic cleanup of temporary test data
- Complete audit trail for all test executions

## Security Considerations

### GitHub Token Handling

// Custom test with parameters
const method = 'POST';
const endpoint = '/api/v1/consciousness/query';
const body = JSON.stringify({
  query: 'How are you feeling today?',
  include_devices: true
});
await executeCustomTest();
```

### GitHub Upload
